# settings_v3.conf file

### GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS ###

# This file MUST be called "settings_v3.conf" and must be placed in
# the same folder as the executable, else the model will not run.

# Only change values to the right hand side of the equals signs.
# Any lines starting with a '#' character are ignored.

### Domain settings ###

## Which geometry to solve?
# Choose 1 for a sphere, 2 for a cylinder, 3 for a cuboid.
geometry=1

## If geometry=1 (the sphere), set radius (in microns) of sphere here
# Decimal point is required
sphere_radius=100.0
# Set integer number of equally spaced radial points to calculate temperature (including the centre and surface)
sphere_radial_meshsize=11

## If geometry=2 (the cylinder), set radius and height (in microns) of cylinder here
# Decimal points are required
cylinder_radius=100.0
cylinder_height=100.0
# Set integer number of equally spaced radial points
cylinder_radial_meshsize=11
# Set integer number of equally spaced points along the cylinder's axis of symmetry
cylinder_height_meshsize=11


## If geometry=3 (the cuboid), set lengths of three sides of cuboid here
# Decimal points are required
cuboid_x_length=500.0
cuboid_y_length=500.0
cuboid_z_length=500.0
# Set integer number of equally spaced points along the x-axis
cuboid_x_meshsize=11
# Set integer number of equally spaced points along the y-axis
cuboid_y_meshsize=11
# Set integer number of equally spaced points along the z-axis
cuboid_z_meshsize=11

### Time settings ###

## Maximum duration of heating - integer number of seconds
# if fixed_max_temperature = true, experiment will probably stop before this number of seconds.
heating_time=50

## Timesteps per second (increase this if model crashes. This needs to be an integer)
timesteps_per_second=50000

#############################

### Physics settings ###

## Fixed maximum temperature ##
#  if true, experiment will stop heating when max temperature reached
fixed_max_temperature=false

## Fixed thermal conductivity ##
#  if true, thermal conductivity will use the value below and be constant
#  throughout the model run. If false, a temperature dependent function 
# (Sekiguchi-Waples Model found in Fundamentals of Basin and Petroleum Systems Modelling,
#  Hantschel and Kauerauf) will be used to calculate thermal conductivity on the fly
fixed_thermal_conductivity=false

## Fixed specific heat capacity ##
#  if true, specific heat capacity will use the value below and be constant
#  throughout the model run. If false, a temperature dependent function 
# (Waples Model found in Fundamentals of Basin and Petroleum Systems Modelling,
#  Hantschel and Kauerauf) will be used to calculate thermal conductivity on the fly
fixed_specific_heat_capacity=false

## Max temperature (in Celsius)
max_temp=600.0

## Initial temperature (in degrees Celsius) of particle and its surface
# Decimal point is required
initial_temp=20.0

## Heating rate (in degrees Celsius per minute)
# Decimal point is required
heating_rate=50.0

## Let experiment reach equilbrium after heating? (true or false - no capitals!)
cooling_phase=true

## Thermal conductivity of bulk material (in Watts per metre per Kelvin)
# Decimal point is required
thermal_conductivity=1.2

## Specific heat capacity of bulk material
# Decimal point is required
specific_heat_capacity=900.0

## Density of bulk material (in kg/m^3)
# Decimal point is required
rock_density=2500.0

### Chemistry settings ###

## Chemistry on
# If true, chemistry will be calculated using data in given .csv file; if false, no chemistry will be modelled
chemistry_on=true

## Chemistry file location
# Give the name of a .csv file in the same directory as this .conf file.
# This file will contain the chemistry data for the various kerogen species.
chemistry_file="sample_chem.csv"

## Kerogen density
# Density of all kerogen species. Decimal point is required
kerogen_density=900.0

## TOC 
# Value between 0 and 100.
# Decimal point is required
TOC_percent=5.0

#############################

### Output settings ###
# Integer number of significant digits; more is best, Excel can do rounding
significant_digits=12

## Log file settings
# A log file will be generated for every run; this is useful for debugging.
# 'log_level' can be set to "normal" or "verbose".
# If log_level="normal", a compact log file will be generated.
# If log_level="verbose", the log file will contain a LOT more info.
# Use "verbose" if the model is crashing unexpectedly; this file will help us
# to pinpoint a potential bug or error. Error messages will appear here.
# Set the log file's name in log_filename. Open the log file with Notepad or any text editor.
log_level="normal"
log_filename="logfile.txt"
